# Ubuntu Bare

A Base setup for creating your own k8s cluster.

I created this setup to train myself in installing different configurations of 
k8s clusters by myself.

## Specs:

- Ubuntu focal (20.04 LTS) - Can be changed
- 1 master vm
- 1 worker vm - adjustable


## Build

```shell
vagrant up --no-parallel
```
